                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>Under federal law, sincerely held religious beliefs ‚Äúinclude moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.‚Äù This does not mean that anyone who does not want to get a vaccine can claim a religious or philosophical exemption simply because they do not agree with receiving the vaccine or vaccine mandates. The U.S. Supreme Court has specifically noted religious beliefs are <i>different</i> and separate from personal beliefs that are ‚Äúessentially political, sociological, or philosophical.‚Äù Therefore, no church cannot offer a letter supporting your desire not to be vaccinated because you personally disagree with the government‚Äôs vaccine requirements.

                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>Covid vaccines were developed incredibly quickly, and it‚Äôs normal to be wary of new breakthroughs like this. The reality is, the development of these vaccines were the result of an unparalleled effort to develop these vaccines as quickly as possible, given the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 virus and how many human lives it could (and has) impacted. The Trump administration kicked off ‚ÄúOperation Warp Speed‚Äù to see if a vaccine could be developed faster than ever by providing unprecedented support from the Federal government. As the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mRNA.html" target="_new">CDC notes</a>, this research was also built on a foundation of over 10 years of mRNA research. Although the technology in these vaccines is new, it is inaccurate to say their development started from scratch and that the mRNA technology in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and their impact are unknown. In fact, mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viruses. </p>
                <p>The speed of the development of these vaccines also does not mean that any of the reliable safety checks for vaccines were skipped or ignored. 386 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US alone and there have been almost no cases of serious side effects. The church believes these vaccines have a phenomenal track record and that God has given the intelligence to develop these vaccines as an important tool to protect ourselves and our communities. </p>
                <p class="quote px-4 pt-3">‚ÄúGiven their safety and availability, receiving a vaccine is an easy way of living out Jesus‚Äôs command to ‚Äòlove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äò‚Äù</p>

                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>While it is true that a cell line derived from an elective abortion in 1972 has been used in the development of vaccines, <strong>no cells from aborted fetuses</strong> were used in the production or testing of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.</p>
                <p>The church also believes it is important to save human lives, and taking any vaccine - even those that were developed using stem cells from fetal tissue - is morally acceptable in order to save lives. Not getting vaccinated puts others' lives in danger, so in order to protect the life that God gave you and others in your community the Church believes we should all get the vaccine.</p>

                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>The church believes science is a tool given to us by God to further His purposes. We use the tools science has given us every day to advocate for the church, including sharing the word of God on the internet, one of Science‚Äôs most potent tools, and use technology to create more efficient and productive farms to feed the poor around the world.

                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>Millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccines, and no long-term side effects have been detected. You may have heard rumors about possible side effects, or seen stories on social media of negative side effects, but God has given us all the power of intellect in order to decipher rumors from truth. The Church advises everyone to get the vaccine because we have seen no credible evidence of negative side effects, while, at the same time we have witnessed the incredible life-saving power of the vaccines. Over 700,000 Americnas have died from the virus so far -- it‚Äôs our job to ensure that we protect the life that God gave us.</p>

                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>Many state and local governments in the US have long mandated vaccines. For example, in states like Alabama vaccines have been required for many years to attend public schools and universities. George Washington, the first President of the United States, was also the first president to mandate vaccinations by requiring his troops to be inoculated against the small pox virus (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/GW&smallpoxinoculation.html" target="_new">source</a>). The Supreme Court has long held that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/briefing/vaccine-mandate-covid.html" target="_new">mandates are constitutional</a> (see <a href="https://casetext.com/case/henning-jacobson-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts" target="_new">Jacobson v. Massachusetts</a>). These mandates are done for the safety of individuals and of the community. The church has also mandated safety protocols for the safety of our community as well. Similarly, federal mandates that require that everyone wear seatbelts reflect how we as a community value the life God has granted all of us, and reflect our need to balance individual freedom and the wellbeing of our communities. The church believes we should embrace these measures to heed God‚Äôs will that we protect all human life. Spurning any step that will protect human life does not align with the Church‚Äôs values. </p>
                <p class="quote px-4 pt-3">Benjamin Franklin, one of founding fathers of the United States and co-author of our constitution, changed his mind about vaccinations after one of his sons died from smallpox in 1736. Franklin had refused to have his son vaccinated, but after his son‚Äôs tragic and unnecessary death from smallpox, Franklin wrote ‚ÄúI long regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not given [the Smallpox vaccination] to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of the parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.‚Äù</p>

                <p><strong>You should know</strong><br/>The fact is, that our actions affect others and we must take that into account when making the important decision about being vaccinated. For example, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/12/alabama-ray-demonia-hospitals-icu/" target="_new">man in Alabama recently died after being turned away from 43 full ICUS</a> because hospitals will full of Covid patients. This man did not die from the Covid virus, he died because many chose not to be vaccinated and as a result contracted the Covid virus and filled up hospital ICUs. The Church believes we must all take action to protect the lives of others when we can, and protecting the lives of others by getting vaccinated is one of the simplest and easiest ways to follow God‚Äôs will. Federal mandates that require that everyone wear seatbelts reflect how we as a community value the life God has granted all of us.

And I think God expected us to use those gifts to understand how to protect ourselves and others from disease. If we have the opportunity to heal through medicine, I think God expects us to do that and not count on some supernatural intervention to come and save us when he's already given us the chance to be saved by other means.‚Äù</p>
